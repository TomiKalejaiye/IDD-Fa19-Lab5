# Jack In A Box

*A lab report by Tomi Kalejaiye*

## In this Report

For this project, I created a box for "summoning" Kurama, the Nine Tailed Fox from the well known Naruto series.
I etched the summoning hand seals from Naruto onto the the walls of the box, laser cut it, then assembled it. I also 3D printed a miniature model of Kurama. I then attached the mini Kurama in the box with a DC motor, such that I can run an Arduino sketch to open the box, and make Kurama pop out. In this prototype, the box is opened by pressing a button, and closes when the button is released. 

In the Naruto series, creatures are summoned by weaving hand signs in a particular order. I would like to ultimately use computer vision to recognize the user's hand poses, and open if the user weaves the proper hand signs in the proper order.

## Part A. Arduino Sketch

The Arduino sketch used for this project is the standard sketch provided by the course. It can be found [here](https://github.com/TomiKalejaiye/IDD-Fa19-Lab5/blob/master/ninetails-kijaidesign-easier-print-02.stl).

## Part B. STL File For Jack

The STL file used for printing the Nine Tailed Fox was created by [@kijai](https://www.myminifactory.com/users/kijai) at MyMiniFactory. The file itself can be found [here](https://github.com/TomiKalejaiye/IDD-Fa19-Lab5/blob/master/JackInABox.ino).
